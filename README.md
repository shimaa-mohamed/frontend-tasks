Task 1

Description

​​Converting an image to a semantically valid HTML is often an overlooked part of the frontend work. Probably because it's not being taught correctly at boot-camps and workshops and because HTML never really complains about the elements you use.
Through the exercise, the candidate should be able to understand that the visual representation of the page doesn't necessarily correlate to the semantic elements that will be used.
As humans, we understand the hierarchy of the page based on the _visual_ context. Machines do not.
For this challenge you are required to convert the design in the link attached below into semantically correct html.
P.S. You shouldn't need elements like `div` and `span` while doing this exercise because we're not creating the user interface yet.
Note that you need to push your task after you’re done, create a merge request then request a review from one of the instructors.
